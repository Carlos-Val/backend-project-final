## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I have created an ecommerce in reference to the sale of comics from an external API that supplied me with the data to be able to handle it and create an application according to my knowledge.

This is the frontend part of the project, which can be searched of various types, from the comics that will be presented in the future to those that have been published in the last month, by characters or by title, in addition to have a profile view where you can see the purchases made or modify your profile.Going through who has written or drawn a particular comic and being able to add all the comics you want to the shopping cart for when you want to be able to buy it.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

####Prerequisites

In order to install the project, NodeJS must be installed, using the version 15.5.1 in this case. We start the project and all its dependencies using the command:

```
npm install
```
#### Installing

Once the dependencies are installed, the project starts by running the command:

````
npm start
````



## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The use of this application is quite simple.

The first thing to do is a registration, if you don't have it. Once you have registered with your personal data, you have to log in.

Once logged in, you are on the main screen of the application and you can move in many directions, from a navbar that takes you to your profile to logout through a help view or even go directly to buy the comics you already have in the shopping cart. From the same main view you can do a search that takes you to the result and you can even see the latest news from the carousel and can select the product that interests you.

## üöÄ In the near and not too distant future... <a name = "future_scope"></a>

TMy intention is to create a few more functionalities to the application, from being able to read the comics that you have bought to creating a chat or forum where you can speak openly about the latest comics, going through creating a section of comics that interest the user.
