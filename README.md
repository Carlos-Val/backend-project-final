## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This part is the backend of my final FullStack Developer project at GeeksHubs.

I have left the backend open to new possibilities that can be added in the future and, in which, I have created a relationship between orders and users, which can list all the comics they have bought.
In addition to having a robust error control when registering or logging in, all of this worked from Laravel.

#### Relations

![relaciones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75422798/117885841-a22f6200-b2ae-11eb-81f0-0162077e78dc.jpg)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
To start working with the repository you have to put three commands:

```
sh docker-run.sh
```
Then, once we have run docker, the following command is:

```
php artisan serve
```
Finally, you create a database to be able to enter the migrations with the following command:

```
php artisan migrate
```

## 🚀 In the near and not too distant future... <a name = "future_scope"></a>


I have left the code open to, in the future, be able to continue making relationships with users and orders, in addition to being able to generate new tables to be able to make this project bigger.
